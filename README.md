# Odin exercice: Etch-a-Sketch

This project is part of the [Odin's Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) *Foundations* course.

The objective was to create an Etch-a-Sketch like drawing board, based on the mouse cursor movements, with adjustable configuration (grid size, rainbow colors, gradual opacity,...).

See live example [here](https://ngoosen.github.io/odin_etch_a_sketch/).
